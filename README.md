Working through the JavaBrains.io SpringBoot course

This is simply a place to keep my work for the javabrains tutorial on springBoot found here:
https://javabrains.io/courses/spring_bootquickstart/


Afterwards, I may use the repository to experiment with different other tutorials or features of SpringBoot / Spring MVC / Hibernate etc.
